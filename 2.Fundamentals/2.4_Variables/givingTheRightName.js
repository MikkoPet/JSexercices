// var names need to be as explicit yet concise as possible
// ourPlanetName indicates all needed parametres: that we are refering to a planet, which planet (ours), and that it is it's name that the variable contains
// currentUserName also does the same, specifying that the variable contains User information, that being specifically the NAME of the CURRENT user.
// any shorter lacks tidbits of information, but it doesn't need to be longer to be descriptive enough
