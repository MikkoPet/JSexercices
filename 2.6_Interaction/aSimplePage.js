let name = prompt("Tell me your name:");

alert(name);

// the prompt() method retrieves data from the user through a pop-up. setting a prompt as the value of a variable then assigns that data to that variable.
// we can then call the variable inside an alert, and the alert pop up will display the data input by the user previously, now stored in the variable called name.
