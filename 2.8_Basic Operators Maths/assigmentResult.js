//What are the values of a and x after the code below?

"use strict"

let a = 2;
let x = 1 + (a *= 2); // a = 4, x = 5

// *= assigns to a variable the value of itself multiplied by the value at the right of the symbol.
// a becomes 4 in the parenthesis
// then the value of a (now 4) is added to 1 and assigned to x
// x is now 5
